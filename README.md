# X-Road Adapter Example

This project provides an example implementation of a web service that's compatible with X-Road version 6. The implementation is based on [XRd4J](https://github.com/petkivim/xrd4j) library. The service contains a single class that
implements two services:

* ```getRandom``` : returns a random number between 1-100
* ```helloService``` : returns a hello message for the given name
